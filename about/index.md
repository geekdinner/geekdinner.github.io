[Geekdinner.be](http://geekdinner.be) was originally registered by [Serge van Ginderachter](http://serge.vanginderachter.be). The initiative already existed under the name "ITPRO", when there was no web 2.0 and computers that talked where something special.

The idea was born when this early IT-er wanted to meet new colleagues so he could exchange experience, share ideas and get some new insights from others. What other place would be better suited than a restaurant.

In the mean time, "geek" became a pop-word and there were already some "geekdinner" initiatives on the evil web. [Geekdinner.be](http://geekdinner.be) still was unregistered, so "ITPRO" got a new name, that reflected the original idea beautifully: bringing geeks together in a friendly atmosphere with some food and drink to share ideas and experiences.
